# FitBuddy
FitBuddy is a running, user- friendly application where the user could track their running activity. FitBuddy records your runs, creates routes for the user to take, helps you set their running goals ,and helps watch your progress as a runner. The user’s experience as a runner doesn’t matter because FitBuddy’s goal is to help users be more healthier and happier with their physical health. The application will have many features that the user could constantly change to fit their needs. The application will have a GPS feature where the GPS creates and tracks your routes and also knows your overall speed and your mile pace. Another feature is a timer that will start and stop for the users. The application will show travelled distance and display it for the user. The personalize feature is the most important because this is where the user could add their personal running/mileage goals, set reminders to complete goals and see their saved history for routes they have taken in the past. 
In the real world, health is important and we know people are constantly trying to find ways to stay healthy and fit.  We know users run. Whether it is to stay fit or simply they use running as a hobby to clear their mind. FitBuddy is the application that makes trying to stay fit easier for the user.
